So React apps are in the end built by combining Components.

## JSX, Props, State

- Reusable Building Blocks
- Related Code Lives Together
- Separation of Concerns

## What's JSX?

And this extension allows developers
to describe and create HTML elements
by writing HTML markup code inside of JavaScript files.

## <font color=blue>**Components functions must follow two important rules. **</font>

- <font color=red>Returns "Renderable" Content</font>

the function must return a renderable value, typically the to-be-rendered HTML markup.
